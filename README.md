An overhaul of my portfolio featuring my current work. The work page is divided into the left side and the right side. The division represents both halves of the brain. Left = logic & Right = Creativity

    * About
        * Contains a bit of information on the designer
        * Includes an illustrated self-portrait
    * Work
        * A list of six projects
        * Each project has two sides: The logic and The creativity
          * I kept everything related to logic, code, and logistics, on the left side
          * I kept everything related to design and visuals, on the right side
    * Contact
        * Contains my current contact information
